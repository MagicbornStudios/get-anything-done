description: >-
  Coordinate a multi-track TUI build (7 tracks, 27+ specs) across
  parallel agents using the slice-by-track model: one agent owns one
  slice end-to-end, slice-level commits reference spec ids, cross-lane
  handoff protocol uses closeout-type frontmatter, self-resume handoff
  carries body schema (task_id, phase, last_commit, what's done /
  left / blocked). Use for TUI sprints with parallel agents or any
  multi-track sprint where coordination overhead would otherwise
  dominate.

# tui-track-slice-coordination

Phase 65's 27-spec TUI sprint shipped via slice-based parallelization —
each agent owned one track end-to-end, slices were independent enough
to ship out of order, and cross-lane handoffs used the canonical
handoff queue with closeout type. This skill captures the requirements
doc shape, the slice contract, the cross-lane protocol, and the
liveness-inference + shell-profile + self-resume primitives that made
multi-agent dispatch tractable.
