description: >-
  Rename a workspace package and/or relocate an app directory atomically
  across a monorepo: inventory all package-name + path refs, `git mv`,
  update package.json, sweep references, update root scripts, optionally
  merge marketing surfaces from one app into another. Use when a
  workspace package or app directory needs reorgs, especially when the
  reorg crosses package boundaries (e.g. `apps/<x>` → `apps/species/<x>`).

# monorepo-rename-and-relocate

Workspace renames are mechanical but the surface is wide — package.json,
cross-package imports, vendor refs, root scripts, turbo/pnpm config, dev
ports, doc references. Phase 68 shipped three such reorgs in one phase
by inventorying refs first, doing atomic moves, sweeping with grep +
sed, and verifying with typecheck + build.

This skill is the checklist that keeps the rename atomic.

**Workflow:** [./workflow.md](./workflow.md)
