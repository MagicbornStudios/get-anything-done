description: >-
  Move a route or small route family between apps in a monorepo,
  rewriting imports + AppShell nav + cross-link CTAs, leaving a
  server-rendered deprecation stub at the old location with install +
  run CLI snippet, and threading an env-driven URL helper
  (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*_URL`) through every cross-app link. Use when a route
  is moving hosts and inbound traffic needs a soft landing.

# move-route-with-deprecation-stub

Route moves between apps require more than `git mv`. Inbound traffic
hits the old URL via bookmarks and internal cross-links; without a
deprecation stub the operator-facing experience is "the route 404s".
Phase 70 captured the canonical move shape: file move + import rewrite,
deprecation stub, env-driven URL helper.

This skill is the three-step checklist for any route move in a multi-app
monorepo.
