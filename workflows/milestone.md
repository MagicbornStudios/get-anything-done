# Milestone Lifecycle

Manages milestone boundaries — the transitions between "shipping v1" and "starting v2". A milestone is a named set of phases that ship together. Closing one cleanly and starting the next is what keeps planning from accumulating drift.

## Detecting mode

Three modes based on context:

- **`audit`** — all or most phases are done; user wants to verify before closing
- **`close`** — audit passed; archive the milestone and tag the release  
- **`new`** — starting fresh work after a closed milestone (or for a new product direction)

Read STATE.md and ROADMAP.md first to determine which mode applies.

---

## Mode: Audit (pre-close integrity check)

Before archiving a milestone, verify it actually delivered what it promised.

### Step 1: Check phase completion

Read ROADMAP.md. For each phase:

| Phase | Status | DoD verified? | SUMMARY.md exists? |
|-------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| `app-auth-01` | done | ✓ | ✓ |
| `app-data-01` | done | ✓ | ✓ |
| `app-ui-02` | done | ✗ missing | ✗ missing |

Flag any phase that is `done` without a verified DoD or SUMMARY.md — these are soft closes.

### Step 2: Check requirements coverage

Read REQUIREMENTS.md. For each v1 requirement:
- Is it marked as delivered? (checkbox or status)
- Is there a phase in ROADMAP.md that covers it?
- Does a SUMMARY.md or VERIFICATION result confirm it shipped?

```
Requirements audit:
  AUTH-01 ✓ — delivered in app-auth-01
  AUTH-02 ✓ — delivered in app-auth-01
  DATA-03 ✗ — no phase covers this requirement
  UI-04 ⚠ — phase done but no verification
```

### Step 3: Check for tech debt and open questions

Scan ERRORS-AND-ATTEMPTS.md and DECISIONS.md for anything flagged as "revisit later" or unresolved. List them — the user decides whether they block the milestone close or carry forward.

### Step 4: Audit result

**If all requirements covered, all phases verified:**
```
Milestone audit: PASSED

All N phases complete, all requirements covered.
Ready to close. Run gad:milestone close when ready.
```

**If gaps found:**
```
Milestone audit: GAPS FOUND

Missing coverage:
  - DATA-03: no phase covers this requirement
  - app-ui-02: phase done but DoD not verified

Options:
  1. Close gaps first — add tasks to cover these before closing
  2. Defer to next milestone — explicitly mark these as v2
  3. Close anyway — acknowledge the gaps and move on
```

---

## Mode: Close (archive and tag)

After audit passes (or gaps are explicitly deferred):

### Step 1: Update REQUIREMENTS.md

Move any explicitly deferred requirements to a "v2" section:

```markdown
## Deferred to v2

| Id | Requirement | Reason |
|----|-------------|--------|
| `DATA-03` | <requirement> | deprioritized post-audit |
```

### Step 2: Archive phase directories

Move completed phase dirs to an archive:

```bash
mkdir -p .planning/milestones/v1-phases/
mv .planning/phases/* .planning/milestones/v1-phases/
```

### Step 3: Snapshot the milestone in ROADMAP.md

Collapse the milestone phases into a single summary line:

```markdown
## v1.0 (archived — <date>)

<N> phases shipped. Requirements: AUTH-01 through DATA-03.
See `.planning/milestones/v1-phases/` for phase history.
```

### Step 4: Tag the release

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "v1.0 — <milestone summary>"
git push --tags
```

### Step 5: Reset STATE.md for the next cycle

```markdown
# State

## Registry

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `status` | `planning` |
| `updated` | <date> |

## Current cycle

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `phase` | — |
| `focus` | v1.0 closed. Planning v2 — run gad:milestone new to start. |

## Next queue

| Priority | Action | Type |
|----------|--------|------|
| `1` | run gad:milestone new to kick off v2 | `planning` |
```

```
Milestone v1.0 closed.

Tagged: v1.0
Archived: .planning/milestones/v1-phases/
State: reset for v2 planning

Next: gad:milestone new OR rp-new-project --milestone to start the next cycle.
```

---

## Mode: New (start next milestone)

Starting a new milestone for an existing project — new goals, continuing phase numbering.

### Step 1: Review what shipped

Read the archived milestone summary and REQUIREMENTS.md v2 section. Understand what carries forward.

### Step 2: Gather new goals

Ask (conversationally):

1. **What's the focus of this milestone?** (one sentence)
2. **What did v1 ship that we're building on?**
3. **What new capabilities are we targeting?**
4. **What's explicitly out of scope for this milestone?**
5. **Any constraints?** (timeline, tech debt to address, dependencies)

### Step 3: Update PROJECT.md

Add a new milestone section:

```markdown
## Milestone: v2.0

**Focus:** <one sentence>
**Building on:** v1 ships [list key v1 capabilities]
**New targets:** [list new goals]
**Out of scope:** [list explicit exclusions]
**Constraints:** [any constraints]

---
*Started: <date>*
```

### Step 4: Write new requirements

Append to REQUIREMENTS.md (don't delete v2 deferred items — promote or re-scope them):

```markdown
## v2 Requirements

### Active

| Id | Requirement | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| `V2-AUTH-01` | <requirement> | `planned` |

### Carried forward from v1

| Id | Requirement | Original | Status |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|
| `DATA-03` | <requirement> | v1 deferred | `active` |
```

### Step 5: Create new roadmap phases

Using the same approach as `rp-plan-phase` — derive phases from new requirements, map every requirement to exactly one phase. Phase IDs continue from where v1 left off (don't restart numbering).

Update ROADMAP.md with the new phases.

### Step 6: Update STATE.md

```markdown
## Current cycle

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `phase` | v2.0 kickoff — phases defined, planning next |
| `focus` | run rp-plan-phase for the first v2 phase |
```

```
Milestone v2.0 started.

Requirements: N new + M carried forward
Phases: N defined in ROADMAP.md

Next: rp-plan-phase for phase <first-v2-phase-id>
```
